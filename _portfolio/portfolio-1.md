title: "Secure Information Flow: from Java Bytecode to NuSMV"
excerpt: "NuSMV is a new implementation and extension of SMV symbolic model checker, aimed for a reliable verification of industrially sized designs. The objective of this project is to model
the Java Bytecode instruction flow of a program. With this model we can automatically check if a program respects the secure information flow property, which means certifying that there is no information leakage.
